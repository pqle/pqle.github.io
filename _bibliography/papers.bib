	abstract = {The emotion of awe occurs when one feels small relative to something vaster than the self; it leads to beneﬁts such as care for others. However, because awe elicits the experience of a “small self,” it is unclear to what extent awe positively versus negatively aﬀects responses to subsequent stressors. If personal obstacles seem trivial in comparison to awe-inspiring stimuli, stressors should seem either manageable or unimportant, but if one's capabilities seem comparatively insigniﬁcant, stressors should seem unmanageable. We hypothesized that awe would have a generally positive eﬀect on responses during a subsequent performance stressor, but that this would further depend on whether people tended to spontaneously take on a self-distanced versus self-immersed perspective. In the face of awe, focusing less on the self (self-distanced perspective) should make obstacles in particular seem trivial, whereas focusing more on the self (self-immersed) should lead one's capabilities to seem insigniﬁcant. Using the biopsychosocial model of challenge/threat, we found that spontaneous self-distancing signiﬁcantly moderated awe's eﬀects on responses during a subsequent performance stressor (speech task): For participants who self-distanced, the awe condition led to cardiovascular responses consistent with greater challenge than the neutral control condition (reﬂecting evaluating the stressor as more manageable); for participants who self-immersed, awe predicted relative threat (less manageable stressor). There was no support for awe making people care less about the stressor (as reﬂected in cardiovascular responses consistent with task engagement). This oﬀers insight into how awe can have divergent eﬀects on people's experiences during performance stressors.},

	abstract = {Self-control-the prioritization of valued global goals over immediate local rewards-is typically conceptualized and studied as isolated decisions. Goal pursuit, however, generally requires people to make repeated self-control decisions across contexts. We adopt a higher order, strategic level of analysis of self-control and explore, for the first time, people's preferences for abstinence (a pattern of choices in which one never indulges) versus moderation (a pattern of choices in which one indulges when doing so does not harm one's goals or even helps promote the pursuit of those goals). To understand when and why people may opt for one over the other, the present work explores one psychological feature that may support these strategy preferences: the representation of self-control conflicts as inherent (i.e., choice options are mutually contradictory) versus situational (i.e., choice options compete for limited resources). We present eight studies in the main text and three in the online Supplemental Materials documenting that people associate inherent and situational conflict representations with abstinence and moderation, respectively. By documenting that strategy preferences may differ as a function of conflict representations, this work questions the assumption of abstinence as the primary indicator of self-control success, raises methodological and conceptual questions about how best to assess these strategy preferences, and calls for greater understanding of self-control as a recurrent decision-making process.

	abstract = {Researchers across theoretical traditions have long recognized the need for people to monitor and modulate certain aspects of their subjective experiences (such as their thoughts and feelings) in response to situational challenges that interfere with the attainment of important goals. Comparatively less attention has been devoted to understanding the beliefs and mechanisms necessary to regulate motivational states—i.e., metamotivation, even though motivational states are often integral to people's subjective experiences of events. As particular types of motivational states are more adaptive in some contexts than in others, flexibly instantiating the right motivational state at the right time may be key to achieving one's goals. The current paper reviews the principles of the metamotivational approach to studying motivation regulation and briefly reviews supporting research. In addition, we highlight metamotivation research conducted in the context of self-affirmation theory to demonstrate the generative potential of this approach for researching phenomena that have traditionally been treated as separate from self-regulation. We conclude by discussing some of the novel questions that the metamotivational approach has prompted, both in and outside of the self-regulatory domain.},

	abstract = {Attitude objects and message sources can differ in their psychological distance to audiences—to what extent they are removed from the audience’s direct experience of “me” in the “here-and-now.” For example, people may view advertisements about a product to be released in the near versus distant future or consider a tour package for a nearby versus remote location. Similarly, persuaders may be communicating to those that they view as similar versus dissimilar from themselves. The present chapter reviews how personalizing messages on the basis of psychological distance (i.e., personalized matching) may enhance persuasion. Construal level theory posits that, to consider distant (vs. near) targets, people must expand (vs. contract) their regulatory scope (i.e., the range of considerations that one accounts for during goal-directed thoughts, feelings, and behaviors). One tool to expand (vs. contract) scope is high-level (vs. low-level) construal. We first discuss how messages that vary in construal level can enhance persuasion when attitude objects are distant versus near to message recipients and, second, when the persuaders rather than the attitude objects are distant versus near to audiences. Finally, we review mechanisms for these effects and discuss directions for future research.},
