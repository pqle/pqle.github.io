Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website.
[Click here to access my CV in a new tab.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jirog8ep0j5jo9vdt08eo/PhuongLe_CV-shared-on-lab-website.docx?rlkey=xmjtxgo7e9d00juz70peanyud&dl=0)

I am a 6th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Psychology at The Ohio State University. In 2017, I received a B.A. in Psychology and Interdisciplinary Social Sciences (International Studies) from SUNY Buffalo.

I am interested in the psychology of how people motivate themselves and others to obtain valued long-term goals. Goal pursuit often requires people to modulate their regulatory scope (i.e., expanding or contracting the range of concerns and possibilities that they account for, Trope et al., 2021). For example, people can transcend beyond the present and consider their global goals to overcome immediate obstacles. In contrast, people may need to contract scope and focus on a task at hand. My research examines the impact of modulating scope on intra- and inter-personal motivational processes. Specifically, I examine three questions:

1.	How do people pursue their long-term goals in face of immediate obstacles?
2.	In what ways can modulating scope aid self-regulation and goal pursuit?
3.	What are the implications for motivating and regulating others?

To answer these questions, I adopt a social cognitive approach and leverage advanced methodologies (e.g., high-powered within-subject experiments and repeated-measures designs, mixed-effects modeling, natural language processing, computational modeling). In addition to making theoretical contributions, I aim to provide actionable recommendations for leaders to enhance motivation and performance.
