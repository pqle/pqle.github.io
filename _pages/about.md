Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website.

I am currently a 6th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Psychology at The Ohio State University, working with Drs. [Kentaro Fujita](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/fujita.5) and [Lisa Libby](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/libby.10). I will soon join Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy as a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. [Abigail Scholer](https://batten.virginia.edu/people/abigail-scholer).

I am interested in the psychology of how people motivate themselves and others to obtain valued long-term goals. My research focuses on people's impressive ability to broaden and narrow the range of concerns and possibilities that they account for in goal pursuit, and how this process impacts motivation. My goal is to help people live up to their goals and provide actionable recommendations for leaders and policymakers to enhance motivation and performance.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
