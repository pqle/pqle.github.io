Thanks for checking out my website.</p> <p>I am interested in the psychology of how people motivate themselves and others to obtain valued long-term goals. My research examines how people modulate the range of concerns and possibilities that they account for in goal pursuit, and how this process impacts motivation. Through research, I aim to provide actionable recommendations for leaders to enhance motivation and performance.</p> <p>I am currently a 6th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Psychology at The Ohio State University, working with Drs. Kentaro Fujita and Lisa Libby. In 2017, I received a B.A. in Psychology and Interdisciplinary Social Sciences (International Studies) from SUNY Buffalo.</p> </body></html>
